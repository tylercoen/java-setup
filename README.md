# 🧩 Java Setup

A personal sandbox for learning and experimenting with **Java fundamentals**.  
This repository is where I’ll explore core Java concepts, syntax, and small projects to build a solid foundation before moving on to more advanced applications.

## 🎯 Goals

- Get comfortable with Java syntax and structure  
- Practice using classes, objects, and inheritance  
- Learn about collections, loops, and control flow  
- Experiment with exception handling and file I/O  
- Understand how to organize and compile projects  
- Build small exercises to reinforce each concept

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Language:** Java (OpenJDK 17 or later)  
- **IDE:** VS Code running inside a **GitHub Codespace**  
- **Build Tool:** Gradle or Maven *(to be decided later)*

## 🧪 Planned Exercises

- Hello World  
- Basic calculator  
- Arrays and lists  
- Object-oriented programming examples  
- File reader/writer  
- Simple CLI app
